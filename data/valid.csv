23342,834,49,Great top,"This is a great casual top. it is true to size and a light weight cotton blend. i am an xxsp which fits me perfectly and the tan and white looks crisp and clean. i keep finding myself choosing this top to wear with jeans, cut offs and white shorts. i am frequently chilly, even in the summer and like the long sleeve which i can roll up or keep down. i wish i bought the other two colors before they sold out in my size.",5,1,0,General,Tops,Blouses
23346,834,42,Love at first sight!,This top is so good i bought every. single. color. i sized up for more flow but it does run true to size. this is that sweet little summer top that we all long for!,5,1,4,General,Tops,Blouses
23349,834,53,"Cute top, flatters large bust","I was a little wary of this top but decided to try anyway. so glad i did. the style is great and the fabric is lightweight and comfy. i debated between the blue and the honey and ended up with the honey. it is just so different yet such a nice neutral. i am normally a size 10 (or maybe a large 8) in tops and purchased this in size 6. it definitely runs large. for reference i am 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd. not sure why another reviewer said this top isn't for large busts. it was very flattering on me an",5,1,0,General,Tops,Blouses
23369,1080,62,Too much fabric,Love the colors and top part but it runs extremely large and there is way too much fabric it is almost like a moo moo. had to return,5,1,1,General,Dresses,Dresses
23379,1110,34,Love!!!,"Gorgeous dress! love that it's flowy, soft, and fits very well. it does run a size smaller. i usually wear a 4 and went with a 2p one this one. the sleeves are a bit tighter on the petite than the regular in the same size.",5,1,2,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
23383,884,44,,I like this top very much. i love the color and the embroidery makes it very dressy. it fits right for me however the picture doesn't show it well but there's a bit too much fabric on the sides.,4,1,2,General Petite,Tops,Knits
23390,1082,38,Too much material at the bottom,"Unfortunately, this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8, 130lbs, and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also, while the dress is lined, both layers are quite thin- not see through, but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material, it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.",2,0,6,General,Dresses,Dresses
23400,834,60,Light weight and comfortable,This top is very light weight and comfortable. i am normally a 8/10 in tops due to my bust size but ordered a 6 based on other reviews. it fits great. i really like the fit and the pattern. it has been a great summer shirt and i can see myself grabbing for it in the fall paired with skinny jeans and a cute bootie.,4,1,0,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
23408,1080,50,,I love this dress but it definitely runs big. i bought a size small and i'm between a 4 and a 6 and will have to return for an xs. the top feels like it will fall down and i'm a size 34c,5,1,7,General,Dresses,Dresses

23423,854,41,Another great tiny top.,"This top is similar to other tiny tops that i have ordered in the past...beautiful embroidery, great neutral and metallic color pallet that goes with everything, and light weight. the top does run small, so i needed the large size to accommodate my 38in bust plus a thin cami (shirt is see through). the large fit similarly to the fit on the model.",5,1,0,General Petite,Tops,Knits
23449,262,39,Not for me,"I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun, and who donse't want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don't think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also, not as comfortable as they looked, the crotch seemed a little ""low"" on me, though the pants were in the correct size.",3,0,7,General Petite,Intimate,Lounge

23473,1104,29,Perfect dress,"Great quality and extremely flattering. bonus that it is on sale. i felt like this dress was a godsend. i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy. i think i'll get a lot of mileage out of it, as there's enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then (hopefully!) i can wear it after too. also can be dressed up or down, so appropriate for many occasions. i believe it runs true to size (i sized up, from xs to s, for obvious reasons, but",5,1,1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

23479,1005,42,What a fun piece!,"So i wasn't sure about ordering this skirt because i couldn't see it in person first but i'm so glad i did. the skirt and design is well made and doesn't look or feel cheap. the color isn't blaring, offensive red so it worked with my pale skin better than i anticipated. i wore it to my daughter's dance production with tall boots and a sweater and i got numerous compliments. fit is true, i am 5'2"" and i picked the petite length. the skirt has a slight a-line rather than a tight pencil fit but the",5,1,0,General Petite,Bottoms,Skirts
