23335,834,54,Weekend cuteness!,"I bought this top in the caramel brown and white. i'm blonde so the color combo is super cute. matched with a lower rise faded, worn jeans rolled and caramel leather slip on gym shoes and it makes such a cute weekend outfit. the top is very light and sheer so a camp underneath. it's a loose fit but not too much. do a little quarter tuck in the front and roll the sleeves and voila! super cuteness!
the fit was great for me as a slender but athletic build, small bust. true to size.",5,1,5,General,Tops,Blouses
23337,834,39,"So cute, honey is surprisingly classy","I so wanted this top in red, and tried on the 0, but it was a little big/long on my 5'1.5"" frame #115 lbs, 30dd#, i tried ordering 0petite, but it was sold out. te only one available was the honey color, so i decided to try it, even though i am very pale... well, i actually do like it. it isn't as popping as the red, but it is super flattering, and the color is actually classy,... so i feel like i could wear this with a dressier outfit, not just casual. i love the feel, the fabric is airy, great",5,1,3,General,Tops,Blouses
23359,1110,63,Perfectly elegant,"I saw this dress but was hesitant to purchase it online because of the reviews. i went to the absolutely fabulous new walnut creek store and though it wasn't on the floor they found one in my size in the storeroom.
i tried it on and was immediately enthralled. i am 5'10 and the dress flowed like a dream. i will be wearing it for my anniversary celebration with pearls and victorian earrings. i can't wait. it is lovely. you may need to be a little taller than average to wear this but it is wonder",5,1,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

23398,834,46,"Easy, springy blouse","This is a great long sleeve, casual shirt for spring - soft and airy. pairs well with jeans. i found that it fit me just right. i'm not very tall, but my shoulders are a little broad for my height, which typically puts me in the ""small/medium"" range, so i got size 6 regular. this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on. very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust. gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel. my only problem is there aren",5,1,8,General Petite,Tops,Blouses

23422,854,40,Beautiful sheer top with weird hem,"I'm undecided about this shirt. this design is absolutely beautiful. but the shirt is very very sheer and the front comes down so low in a curved hem line. so, when you wear the necessary base layer, the shirt extends several inches beyond that and it looks kind of odd. i really wish tiny would make some beautiful shirts like this that aren't sheer and have a shorter front. i purchased my regular size and it fits a little smaller than other tiny shirts i have purchased. since the shirt is so bea",3,1,11,General Petite,Tops,Knits
23424,854,58,Extremely sheer!,Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.,2,0,0,General Petite,Tops,Knits

23454,999,39,Not exactly what i expected,The fabric is very thick and textured almost like upholstery and has no give to it.  the zipper is a little tricky to get all the way up because of the fabric thickness. i looks cute and holds its shape. it may run a touch small because of the fabric. the colors are great though and i really like it.,4,1,1,General,Bottoms,Skirts
23455,1104,35,Cute dress,"This is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric, the top is a little thin, but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer, but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress, but not enough to dissuade me.",4,1,1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

23478,1104,32,Unflattering,I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.,1,0,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
